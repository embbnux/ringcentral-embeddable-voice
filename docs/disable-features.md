# Disable and Enable Features

We provide Call, CallHistory, Messages and ConferenceInvite features in the widget. Sometimes you only need some features. So we allow developers to disable features that unneeded.

## Disable messages features

Just pass `disableMessages` on adapter.js uri or iframe src uri.

## Disable SMS/Text read features

Just pass `disableReadText` on adapter.js uri or iframe src uri.

### Use adapter way:

```js
<script>
  (function() {
    var rcs = document.createElement("script");
    rcs.src = "https://ringcentral.github.io/ringcentral-embeddable/adapter.js?disableMessages=true";
    var rcs0 = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
    rcs0.parentNode.insertBefore(rcs, rcs0);
  })();
</script>
```

## Use iframe way:

```html
<iframe width="300" height="500" id="rc-widget" allow="microphone" src="https://ringcentral.github.io/ringcentral-embeddable/app.html?disableMessages=true">
</iframe>
```

## Disable Call releated features

To pass `disableCall=true` on adapter.js uri or iframe src uri as upper example.

## Disable Meeting feature

To pass `disableMeeting=true` on adapter.js uri or iframe src uri as upper example.

## Enable Glip feature

Glip feature is in beta. It is disabled it by default. To enable it:

```js
<script>
  (function() {
    var rcs = document.createElement("script");
    rcs.src = "https://ringcentral.github.io/ringcentral-embeddable/adapter.js?disableGlip=false";
    var rcs0 = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
    rcs0.parentNode.insertBefore(rcs, rcs0);
  })();
</script>
```

Before we start to use Glip API, need to add `Glip` permission to your app in RingCentral Developer website.

## Enable Conference invite feature

Conference Invite feature will be deprecated in end of 2020. Now it is disabled by default.

To enable it by passing `disableConferenceInvite=false` on adapter.js uri or iframe src uri as upper example.

Please send email to [devsupport](mailto:devsupport@ringcentral.com) to add it if your app has been graduated into production. After permissions added, you can get the feature after re-login to the widget.

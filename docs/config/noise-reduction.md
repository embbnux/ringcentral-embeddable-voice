# Noise reduction

<!-- md:version 1.10.0 -->

> Currently in beta.

Noise reduction is a self-descriptive feature that when enabled, filters out background noise present in the user's environment to create a clearer, easier-to-hear audio stream for people on the other end of a call. Noise reduction is currently only supported within the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.
